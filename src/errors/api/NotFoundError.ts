/**
 * The HTTP 404 Not Found error indicates that the server cannot find the requested
 * resource. Links that lead to a 404 page are often called broken or dead links
 * and can be subject to link rot.
 *
 * A 404 status code only indicates that the resource is missing without indicating
 * if this is temporary or permanent. If a resource is permanently removed, servers
 * should send the 410 Gone status instead.
 *
 * 404 errors on a website can lead to a poor user experience for your visitors,
 * so the number of broken links (internal and external) should be minimized to
 * prevent frustration for readers. Common causes of 404 responses are mistyped
 * URLs or pages that are moved or deleted without redirection.
