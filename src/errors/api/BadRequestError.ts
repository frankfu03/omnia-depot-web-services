/**
 * The HTTP 400 Bad Request error indicates that the server would not process
 * the request due to something the server considered to be a client error.
 * The reason for a 400 response is typically due to malformed request syntax,
 * invalid request message framing, or deceptive request routing.
 *
 * Clients that receive a 400 response should expect that repeating the request
 * without modification will fail with the same error.
