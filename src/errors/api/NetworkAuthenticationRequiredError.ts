/**
 * The HTTP 511 Network Authentication Required error indicates that the client
 * needs to authenticate to gain network access. This status is not generated
 * by origin servers, but by intercepting proxies that control access to a network.
 *
 * Network operators sometimes require some authentication, acceptance of terms,
 * or other user interaction before granting access (for example in an internet
 * caf√© or at an airport). They often identify clients who have not done so using
 * their Media Access Control (MAC) addresses.
