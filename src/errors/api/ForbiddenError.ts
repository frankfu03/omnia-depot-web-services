/**
 * The HTTP 403 Forbidden error indicates that the server understood the request
 * but refused to process it. This status is similar to 401, except that for 403
 * Forbidden responses, authenticating or re-authenticating makes no difference.
 * The request failure is tied to application logic, such as insufficient permissions
 * to a resource or action.
 *
 * Clients that receive a 403 response should expect that repeating the request
 * without modification will fail with the same error. Server owners may decide
 * to send a 404 response instead of a 403 if acknowledging the existence of a
 * resource to clients with insufficient privileges is not desired.
