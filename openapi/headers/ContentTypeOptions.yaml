  The 'X-Content-Type-Options' header is a security measure used to prevent
  MIME type sniffing attacks.

  When set to 'nosniff', it instructs the browser to strictly follow the declared
  Content-Type of the response and not to try to guess or 'sniff' the MIME type
  of the content.

  This header helps to:
  1. Mitigate MIME type confusion attacks;
  2. Ensure that the browser respects the declared Content-Type;
  3. Prevent potentially malicious files from being executed as a different content type.

  Note: this header currently only supports one value 'nosniff'. Any other value is
  ignored by browsers.

schema:
  type: string
  enum: ['nosniff']
  default: nosniff
example: nosniff
